## Importing Packages
Go comes with built in packages for common asks. Check the [Go Standard Library](https://pkg.go.dev/std)

### Third Party Packages
- refer to third party packages with their fully-qualified names, ie: `github.com/google/uuid`
- before downloading a package, you need to initialize a module
- then you can add modules with `go get <module-name>`
  ie: `go get github.com/google/uuid`
